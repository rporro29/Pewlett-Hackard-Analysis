## How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
72, 458 roles will need to be filled 

## Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There are only 1,549 employees that are qualified to train the next generation. Pewlett Hackard will need to change the requirements to qualify for the mentorship program in order to have enough employees to train the new generation.
